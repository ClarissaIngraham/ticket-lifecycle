After the ticket is created, agents will be able to view the ticket in the agent portal.
  
In the example below you will see that we are in the agent portal and Karen has successfully submitted a ticket.

Now we will be adjusting the ticket's SLA Plan and who/where the ticket is going to be assgined. 
  
In the example below, we will be undating the SLA Plan to Sev-1 and reassigning the ticket to an agent on the online banking team.
